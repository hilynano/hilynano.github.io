I study the impact of intragenomic conflicts on chromosome evolution using two complementary systems: Segregation Distorter (SD) and Y chromosome in Drosophila. Intragenomic conflicts can arise due to sex-specific selection or from selfish genetic elements and have wide-ranging effects on genome evolution. SD is an autosomal meiotic drive gene complex that biases its transmission by killing sensitive wild type sperm during spermatogenesis. SD chromosomes tend to acquire inversions that keep the gene complex in linkage. These inversions are usually specific to SD chromosomes but can differ between populations. Y chromosomes are massively rearranged across species and evolve under the conflicts between sexes. In addition, Y chromosomes can be selfish or the target of selfish genetic elements. He has applied recently developed long read sequencing technologies as well as classical cytological methods to study the structural changes on SD and Y chromosomes. He de novo assembled these chromosomes and studied structural changes on the chromosomes using comparative genomics. Using RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, and population genomics, I am trying to understand the evolution of these structural changes. I am familiar with classical fly genetics, bioinformatics and genomics, and cytological methods, including polytene squashes and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH).
