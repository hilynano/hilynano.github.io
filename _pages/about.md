### Research Overview

My research investigates how **intragenomic conflicts** drive chromosome evolution. I focus on two key systems in *Drosophila*:

1.  **Segregation Distorter (SD):** This is an autosomal meiotic drive gene complex that unfairly biases its own transmission by killing sperm that don't carry it. SD chromosomes often acquire unique inversions to keep the gene complex together, though these can differ between populations.
2.  **Y Chromosomes:** These sex chromosomes experience intense evolutionary pressures due to conflicts between sexes and sex-specific selection. They are often hotspots for rearrangements and can act as selfish genetic elements or be targets of them.

My goal is to understand the **structural changes** occurring on SD and Y chromosomes and their evolutionary consequences.

### Methodologies and Expertise

I utilize a multi-faceted approach combining modern genomics with classical techniques:

* **Genomics & Bioinformatics:**
    * Applying **long-read sequencing** technologies for *de novo* assembly of complex chromosomal regions.
    * Using **comparative genomics** to identify and analyze structural variations.
    * Integrating **RNA-seq** and **ChIP-seq** data to explore the functional implications of structural changes.
    * Employing **population genomics** to understand the evolutionary dynamics of these changes.
* **Cytogenetics:**
    * Performing classical **polytene chromosome squashes**.
    * Using **fluorescent *in situ* hybridization (FISH)** for visualizing specific DNA sequences on chromosomes.
* **Classical *Drosophila* Genetics:** Leveraging the powerful genetic toolkit available in fruit flies.

I am proficient in these methods and passionate about unraveling the fascinating interplay between genetic conflict and genome evolution.
