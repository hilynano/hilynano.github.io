## Ching-Ho Chang, PhD

### Current & Upcoming Roles

- **Postdoctoral Fellow**  
  *Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center* (2020 – Present)
  Advisor: Dr. Harmit Malik    
  Studying the evolution of sperm chromatin and mechanisms ensuring fair gamete transmission. 

- **Incoming Principal Investigator**  
  *Institute of Molecular Biology (IMB), Academia Sinica, Taiwan* (Starting 2025)  
  Establishing a research program focused on genetic conflicts and chromatin evolution. 

### Education

- **Ph.D. in Biology**  
  *University of Rochester* (2014 – 2020)  
  Advisor: Dr. Amanda Larracuente  
  Thesis: *Meiotic Drive and Rapid Genome Evolution in Drosophila*

---
### Honors & Fellowships

- **Damon Runyon Postdoctoral Fellowship** (2021 – 2025)  
  Awarded for innovative research on protamine evolution and genetic conflicts in *Drosophila*. 

- **Larry Sandler Memorial Lecture Award** (2021)  
  Recognized for significant contributions to the field of evolutionary genetics.

### Research Focus

My research explores how **genetic conflicts**—such as meiotic drive and sex chromosome antagonism—propel rapid evolutionary changes in chromatin-associated proteins. Utilizing *Drosophila* as a model system, I investigate: [oai_citation_attribution:4‡sinica.edu.tw](https://www.sinica.edu.tw/en/Calendar_Content/57/3716?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

- **Segregation Distorter (SD) System**: An autosomal meiotic drive complex that biases transmission by incapacitating competing sperm.

- **Y Chromosome Dynamics**: Examining how sex chromosome conflicts lead to structural rearrangements and influence genome evolution.

- **Protamines**: Studying the rapid evolution of sperm-specific chromatin proteins and their role in fertility and genomic integrity.  [oai_citation_attribution:5‡ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Ching-Ho-Chang-2130472119?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

### Methodologies and Expertise

I utilize a multi-faceted approach combining modern genomics with classical techniques:

* **Genomics & Bioinformatics:**
    * Applying **long-read sequencing** technologies for *de novo* assembly of complex chromosomal regions.
    * Using **comparative genomics** to identify and analyze structural variations.
    * Integrating **RNA-seq** and **ChIP-seq** data to explore the functional implications of structural changes.
    * Employing **population genomics** to understand the evolutionary dynamics of these changes.
* **Cytogenetics:**
    * Performing classical **polytene chromosome squashes**.
    * Using **fluorescent *in situ* hybridization (FISH)** for visualizing specific DNA sequences on chromosomes.
* **Classical *Drosophila* Genetics:** Leveraging the powerful genetic toolkit available in fruit flies.

I am proficient in these methods and passionate about unraveling the fascinating interplay between genetic conflict and genome evolution.
